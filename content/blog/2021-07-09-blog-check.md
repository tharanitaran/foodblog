Gatsby has lots of advantages:

* Automatic routing based on your directory structure. No need to include additional code for configuring the router
* HTML code is generated server-side
* Pre-configured Webpack-based build system
* Easily extensible by plugin ecosystem
* Optimized for speed. Gatsby loads only critical parts so that your site loads as fast as possible. Once loaded, Gatsby prefetches resources for other pages so that clicking around the site feels incredible fast.
* Easy data integration from sources like CMSs, SaaS services, APIs, databases, file system
